# Aahar
Food Donation Website
This project is aimed at developing a leftover food distribution system. The system is an internet based application named AAHAR. This system provides a website for the needful people who do not get to eat food. There are many people in our country who do not get food or some do not get enough food for their survival. For these people AAHAR may become useful.
This website provides a section for the people who want to donate food. There is a donate option on the website where in they can give details about them and the food which they are providing like the number of peoples that can eat the food, the address of donor etc. Another section is for the NGOs where an NGO can login and they will be provided with the details of the donated food. From here the NGOs can take address of the donor and gather food them and provide it to the poor people.
AAHAR is one of the best opportunity for the people who do not get to eat food. They can easily get the food from an NGO through our website. This will lead to less people starving and the malnutrition can be eradicated.
